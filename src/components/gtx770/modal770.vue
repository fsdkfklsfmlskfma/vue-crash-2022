          The GeForce GTX 770 was a high-end graphics card by NVIDIA, launched
          on May 30th, 2013.
          <br />
          <br />
          Built on the 28 nm process, and based on the GK104 graphics processor, in its GK104-425-A2 variant, the card supports DirectX 12. Even though it supports DirectX 12, the feature level is only 11_0, which can be problematic with newer DirectX 12 titles. The GK104 graphics processor is an average sized chip with a die area of 294 mmÂ² and 3,540 million transistors.
          <br />
          <br />
          It features 1536 shading units, 128 texture mapping units, and 32 ROPs. NVIDIA has paired 2,048 MB GDDR5 memory with the GeForce GTX 770, which are connected using a 256-bit memory interface. 
          <br />
          <br />
          The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1046 MHz, which can be boosted up to 1085 MHz, memory is running at 1753 MHz (7 Gbps effective). 
          <br />
          <br />
          Being a dual-slot card, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 draws power from 1x 6-pin + 1x 8-pin power connector, with power draw rated at 230 W maximum. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Display outputs include: 2x DVI, 1x HDMI 1.4a, 1x DisplayPort 1.2. GeForce GTX 770 is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 3.0 x16 interface. The card's dimensions are 267 mm x 111 mm x 38 mm, and it features a dual-slot cooling solution.
          <br />
          <br />
          Its price at launch was 399 US Dollars.
